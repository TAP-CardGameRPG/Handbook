## About

TAP is a collective card game based role playing game. In the game of TAP, the setting and mood are just as important as the strategy and wit, the atmosphere creates a world saturated in imagination and cunning. The only limits in the game rest between the imagery in your mind and the cards in your hand.

## Roles

In the world of TAP, there are two roles that need to be filled. The role of the campainer and the role of the character. A single session must consist of exactly one campaigner, while all other players are characters.

### Campaigner

The Campaigner is the player who's job it to progress the story. While they do not have a playable character that they control, unlike other players, they take on the role of all other entities in the game. NPCs, monsters, environments, etc. It is their job to progress the story of the campaign above all else.

The campaigner is given a series of missions to complete by the chosen senario of the session and must guide the players along this storyline using any available resources in their disposal in order to complete these missions and move ahead.

### Character

All players who choose the role of a character take control of a fictional character to play as one of the main characters in the storyline. Their job is to grow stronger and strive to complete the missions provided to them by the campaigner.
