# About

TAP is a collective card game based role playing game. In the game of TAP, the setting and mood are just as important as the strategy and wit, the atmosphere creates a world saturated in imagination and cunning. The only limits in the game rest between the imagery in your mind and the cards in your hand.

# Roles

In the world of TAP, there are two roles that need to be filled. The role of the campainer and the role of the character. A single session must consist of exactly one campaigner, while all other players are characters.

## Campaigner

The Campaigner is the player who's job it to progress the story. While they do not have a playable character that they control, unlike other players, they take on the role of all other entities in the game. NPCs, monsters, environments, etc. It is their job to progress the story of the campaign above all else.

The campaigner is given a series of missions to complete by the chosen senario of the session and must guide the players along this storyline using any available resources in their disposal in order to complete these missions and move ahead.

## Character

All players who choose the role of a character take control of a fictional character to play as one of the main characters in the storyline. Their job is to grow stronger and strive to complete the missions provided to them by the campaigner.

# Board Layout

The layout of the cards on the board is an important detail to consider when playing the game. The position of these cards are used to express the current state of the game, the environment setting, the current actions that each player or NPC is preforming, and much more. The layout of the board is different for the player and the campaigner.

## Player's Layout

![Player Layout Diagram](images/TAP%20player%20zones.png)

The player's layout has two major regions. The **Field** and the **Player Reference**. The field consists of individual cards that make up the current condition and move set for the player. These are where cards are placed that are used for preforming actions and showing off turn-critical information quickly and easily. Meanwhile, the Player Reference region is used for storing the long term information about the character. Things that don't change very often or information that doesn't need to be present in each turn.

The player layout has a quite large Field region due to how many cards need to be considered for each action every turn. In contrast, the player has a fairly modest sized Reference region as most of the information that is backlogged can easily be stored in decks or bags as needed.

### Field

* **Active Skill Slots:** These card slots are where the player can place down active skill cards each turn. Players can place up to 6 active skill cards in a single turn. The cards can be placed anywhere within these 6 given slots. See [Active Skills](#active-skills) for more information. If the player is using an item alongside (or instead of) a skill, the item card is also placed here in an active skill slot.

* **Passive Skill Slots:** These card slots are where the player can place down passive skills that they what to activate. Cards that are placed in these slots will remain on the field until the player decides to remove them for any reason or the game requires them to be removed as needed. (I.e. no longer has enough stamina). See [Passive Skills](#passive-skills) for more information.

* **Left/Right Handed + Item/Weapon Slots:** The player is allowed to have up to two items or weapons equipped at any time, unless otherwise stated by the game. These items or weapons may be equipped in these card slots. A common example of this might be equipping a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. If an item or weapon being held requires two hands to hold, it must be placed in the center of the two card slots and prevent any other item or weapon from being held until it is unequipped. See [Held Equipment](#held-equipment) for more information. Certain cards or custom game rules may add certain benefits for which hand is holding which item. (I.e. extra accuracy when using primary hand instead of offhand.)

* **Equipment Slots:** Equipment that is being worn is placed in these slots. Each slot indicates a specific location in which the equipment is being worn. Wearing a hat, for example, would go in the head slot. Any equipment that is not one of the five primary locations is considered an accessory and is placed in the accessory slot. In the base rules of the game, only one item can be equipped in each of these slots. See [Worn Equipment](#worn-equipment) for more information.

* **Status Effect Slots:** If the player has any activate status effects, they are placed in these six slots. This includes both positive and negative status effects as needed. These status effects will remain on the field in these given slots until they are cleared for any reason. See [Status Effects](#status-effects) for more information.

* **Physical Struggle Slots:** If the player has any physical struggles, they can be placed in any of these six provided slots. See [Physical Struggles](#physical-struggles) for more information.

* **Mental Struggle Slots:** If the player has any mental struggles, they can be placed in any of these six provided slots. See [Mental Struggles](#mental-struggles) for more information.

* **Attribute Slots:** Each of the player's 6 attributes are placed in the six corresponding attribute slots. These display the player's base attribute values to use when preforming modifier calculations and skill rolls. See [Attributes](#attributes) for more information.
